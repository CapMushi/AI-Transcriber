# Content Comparison Feature - Original Requirements

## Main Goal
Ingest a primary video/audio as "knowledge base" and compare secondary video/audio content against it to find matching timestamps.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Video/Audio
- Serves as the "knowledge base"
- When uploaded, **delete existing embeddings** in Pinecone DB
- Store transcription and embeddings for comparison
- Display transcription in frontend

### Secondary Video/Audio  
- This is the query video/audio
- **No storage** in Pinecone DB (transcription only)
- Used to search against primary content
- Not displayed in frontend 

### Comparison Logic
- Compare secondary content to primary content
- Determine if secondary content is present within primary
- **Two cases**:
  1. **Not found**: Secondary content not found with 100% certainty → "video/audio not found"
  2. **Found**: Return start and end timestamps where secondary appears in primary

## Technical Constraints
- **No AI chat or agent** functionality needed
- **Minimal changes** to existing functionality
- **Preserve existing transcription workflow**
- **Threshold-based matching** (100% certainty requirement)
- **Clear existing embeddings** when new primary is uploaded

## Frontend Requirements

### File Upload Sections
- **Divide upload into 2 sections**:
  1. Primary video/audio upload
  2. Secondary video/audio upload
- Maintain current color palette and aesthetics

### Transcription Panel
- **Only show transcription for primary video/audio**
- **Preserve existing transcribe button**
- **Add new comparison button** next to transcribe button
- **Display comparison results** at bottom of transcription panel

### Results Display
- **Case 1**: "Content not found" message
- **Case 2**: Show timestamps where secondary content appears in primary
- **Future enhancement**: Highlight matching text in transcription

## Example Workflow
1. Upload primary video/audio → Clear old embeddings → Store new
2. Upload secondary video/audio → Transcribe only
3. Click "Compare Content" button
4. Display results: timestamps or "not found" message

## Future Enhancement (Not Required Now)
- **Text highlighting**: Highlight secondary content within primary transcription
- **Example**: "The brown fox [jumped over the fence] and ran crazy"
- **Interactive timestamps**: Click to navigate to specific times

## Key Principles
- **Minimal disruption** to existing functionality
- **Reuse existing infrastructure** (Whisper, Pinecone, API)
- **Clear separation** between primary and secondary content
- **Consistent UI/UX** with current design patterns
- **No unnecessary improvements** - stick to core requirements
